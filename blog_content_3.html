<h2>15-year vs 30-year mortgage: What the calculator shows</h2>
<p>When it comes to financing your home, one of the most significant decisions you'll make is choosing between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage. Both options have distinct advantages and disadvantages that impact your monthly payments, the total interest you pay, and how quickly you build equity. Our calculator can vividly illustrate these differences, helping you make an informed decision for your financial future.</p>

<h3>The 30-Year Mortgage: Lower Payments, More Flexibility</h3>
<p>The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most popular choice for homebuyers, and for good reason:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**Lower Monthly Payments**: Spreading the loan over a longer period results in significantly lower monthly payments, making homeownership more accessible and freeing up cash flow for other expenses or investments.</li>
    <li>**Increased Affordability**: The lower payments can allow you to qualify for a larger loan amount, potentially enabling you to purchase a more expensive home.</li>
    <li>**Financial Flexibility**: With lower fixed payments, you have more breathing room in your budget. If you face unexpected expenses or a temporary income reduction, these payments are generally easier to manage.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the trade-off is substantial:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**More Interest Paid**: Over 30 years, you will pay significantly more in total interest compared to a 15-year loan, as the interest accrues for a longer duration.</li>
    <li>**Slower Equity Build-Up**: It takes longer to build substantial equity in your home because a larger portion of your early payments goes towards interest.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The 15-Year Mortgage: Faster Payoff, Significant Savings</h3>
<p>While less common, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage offers compelling benefits for those who can manage the higher monthly payments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**Substantial Interest Savings**: Because you're paying off the loan in half the time, you'll save tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan.</li>
    <li>**Faster Equity Build-Up**: A larger portion of your monthly payment goes towards the principal, allowing you to build equity much more quickly. This means you'll own your home outright sooner.</li>
    <li>**Lower Interest Rates**: Lenders typically offer slightly lower interest rates on 15-year mortgages compared to 30-year mortgages, further increasing your savings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary challenge is the higher monthly payment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**Higher Monthly Payments**: Your monthly mortgage payment will be considerably higher, which can strain your budget, especially if unexpected financial events occur.</li>
    <li>**Less Financial Flexibility**: The higher fixed payments leave less disposable income, potentially limiting your ability to save for other goals or handle emergencies.</li>
</ul>
